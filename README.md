## 📋 About The Project

**EatSwiftly** is an early academic project developed during my **3rd semester of B.Tech** as part of my coursework while learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

It represents the initial UI prototype for a digital restaurant ordering system where customers can scan a QR code placed on the table and place orders through a web interface.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository contains only the front-end structure (HTML & CSS) created during the early learning phase. It is not a complete production-ready system and does not include backend, authentication, API integration, or database functionalities.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created with two main objectives:

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **📚 Academic Learning** | To understand and practice core web technologies (HTML layout, Basic CSS styling) as part of the university curriculum |
| **🔮 Future System Blueprint** | To conceptualize the idea of a QR-based restaurant ordering platform and design a simple UI that could be extended into a full system later |

---

## ✨ Features (UI Prototype Only)

- 📱 Basic landing page structure
- 🍕 Menu section layout (static)
- 🎨 Simple styles using pure CSS
- 🧭 Responsive structure (partial)
- ⚡ Lightweight, no frameworks used

---

## 🌱 Current Status

**This is NOT a finished application.**

At this stage, the project:

- ❌ Has no JavaScript functionality
- ❌ Has no backend
- ❌ Lacks real ordering features
- ✅ Is mainly a UI mockup built for learning purposes

---

## 🚀 Future Improvement Plans

I plan to enhance this project in the future by:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| JavaScript | Adding interactivity |
| Backend | Building server (Node.js / Django / Laravel etc.) |
| Database | Implementing database system (MongoDB / MySQL) |
| QR Flow | Creating a complete QR-based ordering flow |
| Admin Panel | Adding panel for managing menu & orders |
| Auth & Payment | Integrating authentication and payment options |

## 📚 Why This Repo Is Public

This repository is intentionally kept public to:

- 📈 Track my growth in web development
- 🔍 Showcase early projects transparently
- 📊 Demonstrate learning progression over time

> Although it is a simple project, it played an important role in helping me understand the basics of front-end development.
